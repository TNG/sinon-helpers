## Motivation

Especially when working with the new ES6 classes, a common problem in unit testing is to find out if a module creates
instances of a class using the right constructor arguments and which methods are called on these instances. Moreover,
it would be nice to be able to control that these classes are properly stubbed i.e. that in our tests, none of the
original class code is executed.

New test dependencies can be easily injected with [rewire](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire) or
[proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire) for [node](https://nodejs.org) testing and
[inject-loader](https://github.com/plasticine/inject-loader) or
[babel-plugin-rewire](https://github.com/speedskater/babel-plugin-rewire) for [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
testing. The question remains how the stated goal can be achieved using a mocking library such as
[sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon).

In the examples, we want to mock a constructor `MyConstructor`.

### Simple approaches

* Replace `MyConstructor` by `sinon.stub(MyConstructor)`. That way, we can find out which parameters are used to create
instances. The instances, however, will feature none of the methods of `MyConstructor`.
* Do the same using `sinon.spy(MyConstructor)` instead. But now the original code is executed as well and we still
cannot test method invocations.
* To test method invocations, we could stub methods of the prototype i.e.
`sinon.stub(MyConstructor.prototype, 'myMethod')` (do not forget to remove your stub after the test!), or if
`MyConstructorStub = sinon.stub(MyConstructor)`, we could use `MyConstructorStub.prototype.myMethod = sinon.stub()` to
add the corresponding stubs. Now, however, all instances share the same stubs and we cannot match stub invocations with
the instances on which they were invoked.

To really solve this problem, we will need to create our own custom constructor. **sinon-helpers** is a library that
offers an easy and generic solution to this problem.

### What **sinon-helpers** offers

* `MyStubConstructor = getStubConstructor(MyConstructor)` generates a new constructor using `MyConstrucor` as a
template. That means that new instances will contain all methods of `MyConstructor` as stubs including inherited and
non-enumerable methods but skipping getters.
* `MyStubConstructor.getInstances()` returns an array of all instances that have been created using this constructor.
If you expect only a single instance to be created, you can retrieve it directly via `MyStubConstructor.getInstance()`,
which will also throw an error if more than one or no instance has been created.
Thus you can test for all instances separately which methods have been invoked in which way.
* `MyStubConstructor.getInstancesArgs()` returns an array of arrays of arguments used to create the instances.
* There is a simple way to define return values for methods and you can even define that a method returns its
`this`-value if you need to stub a [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface).
* As the prototype is not modified, you do not have to clean up your stubs after the test!

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save-dev sinon-helpers
```

or

```bash
yarn add --dev sinon-helpers
```

## Usage
```javascript
var sh = require('sinon-helpers') // CommonJS
import * as sh from 'sinon-helpers' // ES6
// alternative: import {getStubConstructor, getSpyConstructor, returning} from 'sinon-helpers'

// Create a constructor mimicking a given constructor
var MyStubConstructor = sh.getStubConstructor(MyConstructor)

// You may also add new methods and provide return values to existing methods
MyStubConstructor = MyStubConstructor.withMethods('method1', sh.returning(1), 'method2', sh.returningThis)

// Create a constructor that calls through to the original constructor
// with spies on all methods and having a few methods stubbed
var MySpyConstructor = sh.getSpyConstructor(MyConstructor).withStubs('method1', 'method2', sh.returning(true))

// Create an object with the given methods as stubs
var myMethods = sh.getMethodStubs('method1', 'method2', sh.returning('Hello'))
```

## API
### `getStubConstructor(<OriginalConstructor>)`
Returns a [`StubConstructor`](#stubconstructor-api) mimicking the given constructor `OriginalConstructor`. When called
with `new`, this constructor creates an object with stubs for any methods of the prototype object of `ConstructorName`.
If you call `getStubConstructor` without any arguments, you receive a StubConstructor without any pre-defined methods.
Any `StubConstructor` features several methods to add methods and query created instances.

### `StubConstructor` API
A `StubConstructor` has the following methods:
* `.withMethods('method1' <,'method2' <...>>)`  
  Instances should have the listed additional methods as stubs. Returns the `StubConstructor` so you can assign
    
  ```javascript
  var Stub = getStubConstructor(MyConstructor).withMethods('myMethod')
  ```
    
  `.withMethods` also [allows you to specify method return values](#specifying-stub-return-values), see below.
* `.afterCreation(onAfterCreation)`  
  When a new instance is created, `onAfterCreation(instance)` is called receiving the new instance as parameter; this
  enables you to perform manual post-processing like adding additional fields before the instance is returned.
* `.getInstances()`   
  Returns an array of instances created with the stub constructor.
* `.getInstance()`  
  Throws an error if no or more than one instance has been created. Otherwise, returns the instance created.
* `.getInstance(index)`  
  Throws an error if not at least `index` instances have been created. Otherwise, returns the instance `index`.
* `.getInstancesArgs()`  
  Returns an array of arrays containing the arguments of each instance creation.
* `.getInstanceArgs()`  
  Throws an error if no or more than one instance has been created. Otherwise, returns the arguments with which the
  instance has been created.
* `.getInstanceArgs(index)`  
  Throws an error if not at least `index` instances have been created. Otherwise, returns the arguments with which
  instance `index` has been created.

### `getSpyConstructor(OriginalConstructor)`
Returns a [`SpyConstructor`](#spyconstructor-api) of the given constructor `OriginalConstructor`. A `SpyConstructor` is
similar to a `StubConstructor` except for the following differences:
* The `OriginalConstructor` is called when creating a new instance.
* Methods are not stubbed but spied on (but you may manually stub some methods).
* Which methods are spied on is not determined by looking at the prototype but by looking at what methods are actually
present after the constructor has run.

This is useful if you need to preserve the constructor's functionality while being able to track its instances. Note
however that having to rely on `SpyConstructor`s instead of `StubConstructor`s may be an indication of strong couplings
in you software that are generally a sign that your architecture could be improved.

### `SpyConstructor` API
A `SpyConstructor` has the following methods:
* `.withStubs('method1' <,'method2' <...>>)`  
  Instead of spied on, instances should have the listed methods as stubs. If these methods do not exist, an error will
  be thrown. Returns the `SpyConstructor` so you can assign
  
  ```javascript
  var Spy = getSpyConstructor(MyConstructor).withStubs('myMethod')
  ```
  
  `.withStubs` also [allows you to specify stub return values](#specifying-stub-return-values), see below.
* `.afterCreation(onAfterCreation)`  
  When a new instance is created, `onAfterCreation(instance)` is called receiving the new instance as parameter; this
  enables you to perform manual post-processing like adding additional fields before the instance is returned.
* `.getInstances()`   
  Returns an array of instances created with the spy constructor.
* `.getInstance()`  
  Throws an error if no or more than one instance has been created. Otherwise, returns the instance created.
* `.getInstance(index)`  
  Throws an error if not at least `index` instances have been created. Otherwise, returns the instance `index`.
* `.getInstancesArgs()`  
  Returns an array of arrays containing the arguments of each instance creation.
* `.getInstanceArgs()`  
  Throws an error if no or more than one instance has been created. Otherwise, returns the arguments with which the
  instance has been created.
* `.getInstanceArgs(index)`  
  Throws an error if not at least `index` instances have been created. Otherwise, returns the arguments with which
  instance `index` has been created.

### `getMethodStubs(methodName1 <, methodName2 ...>)`
Returns an object containing the given methods as stubs. Again, `getMethodStubs`
[allows you to specify stub return values](#specifying-stub-return-values).

### Specifying stub return values
`sinon-helpers` allows you to specify return values for any created stub methods:

```javascript
var Stub = sh.getStubConstructor(MyConstructor).withMethods(
             'method1', sh.returning(3),
             'method2', sh.returningThis,
             'method3'
           )
```

This creates a `StubConstructor` where any instance has the three methods `.method1()`, `.method2()` and `.method3()`.
`.method1()` always returns `3`, `.method2()` returns its `this` value and `.method3()` returns `undefined`. This
can also be used to add return values to prototype methods. This also works with `SpyConstrucor`s:

```javascript
var Spy = sh.getSpyConstructor(MyConstructor).withStubs(
             'method1', sh.returning(3),
             'method2', sh.returningThis,
             'method3'
           )
```

This creates a `SpyConstructor` where for any instance, `.method1()`, `.method2()` and `.method3()` are stubbed, and
`.method1()` always returns `3`, `.method2()` returns its `this` value and `.method3()` returns `undefined`.  
With `getMethodStubs()`, you can do the same:

```javascript
var methodStubs = sh.getMethodStubs(
                     'method1', sh.returning(3),
                     'method2', sh.returningThis,
                     'method3'
                  )
```
