# How to contribute

### You found a bug or something is not working as expected
* Ideally: File a pull request with a red test! (but take a look at the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) first)
* Also nice: File a pull request with a test and a proposed fix :)
* If you can do neither: File an issue outlining the expected behavior, actual behavior, and steps to reproduce the problem.

### You have an idea on how to improve the package
* If you want to show anything by code, or actually want to contribute code, file a pull request. Even if it is not merged,
  this pull request makes it easier to discuss the proposed changes.
* Otherwise, please file an issue.

### Coding Guidelines
* Code style must follow the [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) rules.
* Commit messages must follow the [AngularJS Commit Message Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit);

If you `npm install` before committing anything, both should be enforced automatically.
